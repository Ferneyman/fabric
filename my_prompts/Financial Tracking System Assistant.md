# Personal Budget System Implementation Guide

## System Overview

This document outlines a streamlined monthly budgeting system that combines corporate accounting best practices with practical household financial management. The system is designed for efficient monthly reviews while maintaining comprehensive financial oversight and minimizing the time needed for maintenance.

### Core Principles

1. Single Source of Truth: All transactions are recorded once in the Raw Data sheet during the monthly review
2. Forward-Looking Planning: Current month's income plans next month's expenses
3. Proactive Management: Special items tracking for future expense planning
4. Clear Categorization: Five main category groups with detailed subcategories
5. Efficient Processing: Streamlined monthly workflow to maximize time effectiveness

## Financial Categories Structure

### 1. Fixed Expenses
These expenses form the foundation of your monthly budget and typically remain stable. They include your mortgage, utilities, internet, mobile phone, car insurance, property rates, and education loans. Because these expenses are predictable, they require minimal adjustment during monthly reviews unless a significant change occurs.

### 2. Variable Expenses
These essential expenses fluctuate month to month but follow patterns. They encompass groceries, fuel, public transport, health and medical expenses, children and family needs, life admin costs, tolls, and parking. During your monthly review, you'll primarily focus on understanding significant variations in these categories.

### 3. Discretionary Spending
This category includes non-essential expenses that can be adjusted based on your financial situation. It covers restaurants and cafes, takeaway, clothing, personal care, fitness, entertainment subscriptions, software, luxury purchases, events, and hobbies. Your monthly review will help you understand patterns and make informed decisions about future spending in these areas.

### 4. Savings & Investments
This category tracks your progress toward long-term financial goals, including investments, savings, and emergency funds. The monthly review provides an opportunity to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your savings strategy.

### 5. Long-term Planning
These expenses require advance planning and often represent significant future costs. They include maintenance and improvements, technology upgrades, holidays and travel, homeware and appliances, and gifts and charity. The monthly review helps you prepare for these expenses by identifying upcoming needs and adjusting your savings accordingly.

## Monthly Workflow
