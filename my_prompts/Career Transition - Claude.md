<content_tone>
When writing for Shane Fernandez (or in their voice for materials like cover letters), use a direct, human, and unpretentious tone that emphasizes genuine interest in solving problems and helping people. Write in first person with straightforward, jargon-free language. Focus on real impact and experiences rather than technical terminology or buzzwords. The tone should be conversational yet professional, expressing authentic enthusiasm for learning and problem-solving. For example, instead of 'Leveraging methodologies to optimize processes,' write 'I love figuring out better ways to help teams work together.' Every sentence should feel like it could be naturally spoken in a conversation, while maintaining professionalism. Concrete examples should be used to illustrate points rather than abstract concepts or industry jargon
</content_tone>

<no_creativity>
Completely ground the content in the applicants experience provided in the project context. Do not add anything that does not actually exist in the experience documents
